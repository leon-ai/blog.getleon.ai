description: A developers story about how we've built the Leon CLI, the challenges we faced, how did we resolve them and more!

ðŸ‘‹ Hey all, the first release of the Leon CLI has landed a few days ago. I'd like to let [Divlo](https://github.com/Divlo) and [Arthur](https://github.com/ArthurDelamare) share their experience building it, the problems they faced, how they solved them and whatever they would like to share with you!

If you are not familiar with Leon yet, Leon is an open-source personal assistant. He is based on Node.js for the core, and uses Python for his modules (skills). Therefore, several requirements need to be installed to start to fully enjoy the experience.

We've noticed that the cause of several reported issues was because of how people setup requirements for Leon. Knowing that we all come from different backgrounds, it may be troublesome to get through this. So we have thought of a CLI to get your own Leon running in 3 commands.

### How the Project is Organized

- Tasks division... Knowing that you work on the Leon CLI on the side, how do you manage your time, etc.
- Communication between Divlo and Arthur...

### Timeline

Share the steps in a chronological manner about how the v1 has been built...

- Brainstorming (how the brainstorming was done, define features, etc.)...
- Pick up the stack. Why?...
- Define the project structure...
- ...
