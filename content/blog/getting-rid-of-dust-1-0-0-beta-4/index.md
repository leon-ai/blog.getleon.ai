description: After 2 years, a new release is finally out... Learn about technical debt and what this release contains.
---

ðŸ‘‹ Hey all, the time has come... Like **finally**! I know it has been a long time. The project has been paused for about 2 years. We'll talk about the reasons of this endless pause in another blog post.

Today, we'll focus on this new release and understand what's new and where the project is leading to.

## Main Focus

The focus of this release is quite obvious. 2 years pause on a project requires a deep work on:

1. Rethinking about the project vision.
2. Redefining who would be interested in the project.
3. Analyzing technical debt and taking action.

At least that's how I put it together.

It's important to mention that the work here was not only technical. I needed to refocus on the **WHY** of Leon.

- Why did I build Leon at the first place?
- What problems is it solving?
- Is it still valuable today?

Let's focus on the technical part as the other part will be covered in another blog post.

### Dependency Updates

Let images speak for themselves...



This is what happens when you don't update your project dependencies for about 2 years... Luckily npm is a well advanced packages manager, but imagine if you don't have any visibilities on your tree dependencies. So we must feel lucky to have such great tools out there to solve this.
