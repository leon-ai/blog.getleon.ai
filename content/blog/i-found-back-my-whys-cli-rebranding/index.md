ðŸ‘‹ Hey all, I mentioned in the previous blog posts that I'd share with you the reasons of my missing, the vision I have for Leon and more about what's going on in my head, so now is the time. Besides that, there are great news to announce. Let's get started!


## Coming Back

...

### My Missing

What I did, what I have learned

Explain my missing. Lots of questionning in my career. Wanted to try other fields: 2aud.io, agency with friend, computer vision, French developers community with learning courses about Node.js, etc. I always had these things in mind I wanted to build, I wanted to try them out first by knowing that my ultimate goal is to come back on Leon.

Too much things happened? Made me lose focus.
Tried to ignore it with other project?
Was in a good dynamic of building new things, mistake: I lost focus

Ego building?

Biggest fear: be on my death bed, did not really accomplish what I wanted. But deeply inside me, I always knew that Leon was my life project. I still try to figure out why I paused it... Was I afraid? Is it related to the imposter syndrome?

What I learned from this

> Hype does not length forever, need to be reactive and proactive. Need to listen to my deep me.

The Truth.

I met a girl, wanted to show what I was capable of, ego building, so 2aud.io, etc.

Joined Ali on the Lazada business, so exciting!

What I have learned along the way: how it can be useful for Leon (React, computer vision, building a community (+700 applications), producing video content, etc.). How I did this, etc. Ah and stick around because I'd like to reproduce the same model of community for Leon ;)

Explain how the community will be important

### I Found Back my WHYs

I see it like this: there is a practical WHY, and a deep WHY. Practical = the project itself, what problem it is solving, etc. Deep = my source of energy to solve the practical. The deep WHY is the fuel of my practical WHY. Explain my deep WHY and my practical WHY.

As mentioned in the previous blog post, I needed to refocus on the WHY of Leon before to focus on the technical part. So here is the WHY [...] I believe that we cannot just find "motivation" without a why. The why is the fuel that pushes me to move forward. 

Explain why going full React...

### Vision for Leon

Share the next milestones and the vision of Leon + the ideal future for the project + why these milestones + I opened a GitHub sponsor

FOCUS 
1. Foundations/core
2. Need to cover most use case that existing assistant covers
3. Growing community
4. Make it smarter and new iterations from private roadmap

## Rebranding

Along with the vision... Rebranding... 

Visual identity: explain atmosphere and why. Sketch to design: sketch, then black and white then colors/shadows/details then web with animations

Reasons behind this rebranding:

- 2 years pause, need something fresh
- Never really explained the vision of the project
- Want the vision be inside the visual identity

How I built the new landing page (tooling, SWC from Next.js, etc. optimize animations, etc.)

Vercel sponsoring

## CLI

Why did we build a CLI? Most of the issues we receive are about requirements. So it seems there were a need to cover here.

Introduce new main contributors. As working full-time again at... Then we can get on a higher speed here with more people

CLI release, please share your feedback

Features in the CLI

Let's get started now: show commands to install
